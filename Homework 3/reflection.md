# Homework 3 Reflection

## Comparison: My Sketch vs. Gen AI
My sketch is an iteration of my "Cozy Music Corner" where I added a red ball that moves around the room. I used a simple speed variable and if statements to make the ball bounce off the edges of the canvas. For interactivity, I used the `mousePressed` function so that every time a user clicks, the ball jumps to a new random location.

The AI-generated sketch used a different approach for its movement. It focused on making the record on the turntable spin using rotation math, and it added a "sun" shape in the window that moved back and forth. Its interactivity was a bit more complex, using a "true/false" toggle to start and stop the record.

## What I Learned
Using Gen AI was helpful for seeing how to handle different types of motion. While my ball uses basic X and Y addition, the AI showed how to use rotation. I found it useful as a reference for how to toggle an animation on and off, but it was a bit unhelpful because the code it gave was more complicated than what I actually needed for my design.

## Conclusion
The AI is a good tool for looking up how to do specific technical things, like spinning a shape. However, I preferred writing my own code for the bouncing ball because it was easier to control and fit better with the simple shape-based style of my project.
