  Taylor's Pizza Paradise - Homework 4
  By: Taylor Plovanich
  
  GENERATIVE AI REFLECTION:
  
  Which Generative AI image model did you use?
  I used Bing Image Creator (DALL-E 3) to generate my pizza image.
  
  Why did you choose that specific one?
  I chose it because it's free and easy to use without signing up for anything.
  
  What was your prompt like?
  My prompt was: "pepperoni pizza top view"
  
  Was the image what you expected? Why or why not?
  Yes! It made a realistic looking pizza that fit my project perfectly.
  
  How did the image contribute to your overall project?
  The AI pizza image became the main focus of my scene. It looks professional
  and makes the whole project look better than if I just drew shapes.
